# Press Release 2: Commercial Success in India
### Bollywood to the World: Netflix’s Hindi-Language Hits Growth in India

![India Movies on Netflix (Source: Netflix)](images/hindimovie.webp){fig-alt="India Movies on Netflix (Source: Netflix)" width=100% }
Netflix’s latest data underscores the remarkable rise of Hindi-language films and series, which are dominating India’s Top 10 while breaking through to global audiences. As India becomes the world’s most populous country, this momentum highlights its central role in Netflix’s long-term growth strategy.

## Loyal Fans 
* Hindi-language titles are proving to be long-term favorites with Indian viewers.

  - The Great Indian Kapil Show spent an extraordinary 44 weeks in India’s Top 10.
  
  - The Railway Men charted for 30 weeks, and Khakee: The Bihar Chapter for 29 weeks.

* These extended runs demonstrate Netflix’s growing audience loyalty and the staying power of local storytelling.

## Global Reach of Hindi-Language Shows
* Indian hits captured audiences worldwide, with several titles making Netflix’s Global Top 10.

  - Lucky Baskhar and The Great Indian Kapil Show each earned 19.4 million cumulative views.
  
  - Animal drew 13.6 million cumulative views
  
  - The Railway Men reached 8.2 million cumulative views
  
* In total, 12 Hindi-language shows have appeared in the Global Top 10.

* This global impact shows Hindi-language content is capturing audiences outside of India.

With India’s scale and surging demand, Netflix has a unique opportunity to strengthen its presence by investing more in Hindi-language productions and amplifying their global reach. By partnering with local creators and expanding original programming, Netflix can further solidify its position in India—while bringing Bollywood and Hindi stories to audiences around the world.

# Press Release 3: Open Topic

### Holiday Blockbusters: Netflix Animated Hits Top the Charts

![Animated Movies for Holidays (Source: Netflix)](images/animatedmovie.png){fig-alt="Animated Movies for Holidays (Source: Netflix)" width=100% }


Netflix’s viewership study shows animated and family-friendly films thrive during holidays, especially Christmas, drawing kids, parents, and nostalgic adults alike. The data, based on Global Top 10 performance—weeks on chart, total views, and hours watched—confirms cartoons’ broad appeal and status as a holiday tradition.

## Christmas & New Year’s (November–January): Animated Films Take Over

* All 10 top films are animated, showcasing animated films loved by audiences during holiday season.

* Standouts during Christmas & New Year's months include:

  - The Boss Baby (22 weeks, 49M views, 130M hours) 

  - Despicable Me 2 (19 weeks, 48M views, 159M hours)

  - KPop Demon Hunters (14 weeks, 335M views, 559M hours)

* Additional animated films, such as Minions and Shrek, maintained significant visibility, highlighting the popularity of animated content.

## Summer (June–August): Fun, Too

* Seven out of the Top 10 summer films were animated.

* Films including Sing 2, Paw Patrol: The Movie, and Hotel Transylvania 3 competed alongside high-action releases such as Extraction 2 and The Man from Toronto.

* Notably, KPop Demon Hunters recorded 443 million hours viewed during summer months, demonstrating that animated content can rival major live-action releases in audience reach and engagement.

## Easter (March–May): A Balanced Mix

* Easter viewing periods exhibited a mix of animated films (Shrek, Despicable Me 4, Sonic the Hedgehog) and live-action titles (The Adam Project, Damsel).

* This reflects a transitional season where audience interests span both family-focused and broader-appeal content.

These findings confirm that animated films are a powerful and consistent draw for audiences year-round, especially during the festive seasons. This isn't just a trend; it's a clear signal that families and kids are a huge part of the global audience. We can expect Netflix to deliver even more animated magic in the future to make every holiday a little more joyful and a lot more fun.
